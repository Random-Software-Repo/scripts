## PMV more or less is the same as mv, but will make some assumptions about the final parameter
## given and how it relates the the directory defined in $PORTALM.
## If the final parameter is not a directory, but is a subdirectory within $PORTALM, then the subdirectory within $PORTALM will be used instead
## If the final parameter is not a directory, and there is at least one more parameter, then $PORTALM will becomethe target for the move
## If the final parameter is an existing file and there are more than one preceeding parameters, the move will fail as that would lose data

## $PORTALM must be set in the environment prior to running pmv. if $PORTALM is not set, pmv will exit
