# scripts
A variety of interpreted command line scripts. These are largely indepentent and faily small scripts. Anything large, or more involved will probably deserve it's own github repo.

## Shell
the shell directory contains shell scripts: BASH, SH, or ZSH scripts (currently nearly all ZSH).

## Building
Build and install the scripts with Gnu Make (make on most Linux distrobutions, gmake on FreeBSD):

```
make install
```
